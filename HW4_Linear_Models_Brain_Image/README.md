# Starter Code for CSE 5523 Homework: Linear Models on Brain Image Data
See instructions.pdf

I used Python3 for writing, debugging and outputing the results and figures. I used Pycharm CE IDE. All the outputs are extracted in the folder "Output" in the attached folder. The code and report files are names as "linear_brain_vFIN.py" and "HW4_report.pdf"
